### 2023-04-03 Welcome to the AL Home and AL Explorer üòÉüòÉüëèüëè

You're reading this in one of the two new views added to the AL Language extension for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, namely AL Home and AL Explorer.

## AL Home
The AL Home shows news related to developing in AL for Business Central. It'll be used to share news, best practices, upcoming events, urgent information and status, and learn content.

## AL Explorer
The AL Explorer lets you easily browse your objects and the ones coming from apps in your dependencies. It's structured into four sections with the focus on extensibility points. These sections are: Objects, Events, Apis, Extensible Enums.

- Objects: Contains a collection of all the codeunits, tables, pages, pageextensions, reports, etc.
- Events: Contains the integration and business events made available to be subscribed to.
- Apis: Provides all the API pages.
- Extensible Enums: These are all the enums, which are extensible and that implement an interface.

## Filtering and grouping
In order to easier find what you are looking for, the AL Explorer provides search functionality to filter down the list based on the ID or Name. It also has Grouping options, which is fitted to match each section. The last option is to filter based on your bookmarked objects, the project in your workspace you want to target, or the app from your dependencies you want to explore.

## Advanced features
Some of you might recognize the look and feel of the AL Explorer's grid. It is built using the same component as analysis mode in the web client, which provides some capabilities that can be good to know.

- Sort using multiple columns by holding down shift you can click one column after the next one to set up the order of sorting done. 
- In the webclient it is possible to define a freeze pane, and the same functionality is possible here, by dragging a column to the top right or left, and holding it there for a moment. 
- Resizing columns can either be to the column on the left by default or to the one on the right, by holding down shift. 
- You can also reorder the columns to your liking by drag and dropping them.
